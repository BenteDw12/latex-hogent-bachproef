  abstractnote  = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This research aims to deliver valuable insights into PHP-based content management systems (CMS) by assesing the various comparison methods, techniques and assessment studies. This research study illuminates the importance status of a robust CMS in enabling users to seamlessly integrate diverse functionalities into their websites through plugins and widgets. Emphasizing the worth of modular architecture, PHP is utilized for customizing the user interface, while a CMS efficiently manages the websiteâ€™s content. All the popular PHP-based digital tools such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal are explored within this context. Real-world case studies and examples are curated to offer practical perspectives on CMS utilization. Despite the plethora of software packages available for CMS, selecting the most suitable one can be challenging due to the disparate nature of trend and evaluation data. Through our findings, we address the advantages and disadvantages associated with WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. WordPress stands out for its extensive array of plugins, enhancing its user-friendliness and basic functionality. However, Joomla may require additional essential capabilities despite its overall usability. On the other hand, Drupal emerges as a commendable choice for both simple and intermediate websites, boasting straightforward management capabilities. Ultimately, we advocate for business owners to leverage trend data alongside their specific requirements in selecting a CMS that aligns with their web strategy, ensuring continued support and adaptability for future endeavors.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
